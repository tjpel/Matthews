Currently, the site has three obsolete multifamily buildings, totaling 16 units, that were built in the early 20th century. Those buildings will need to be demolished to make way for any new developments. 

This transaction is one of the first sales since the Los Angeles “Mansion Tax”, which took effect on April 1, 2023, that has nearly halted the local real estate market. The Mansion Tax affects real estate sales in the City of Los Angeles that trade above $5 million, on top of the standard excise tax. The seller in this transaction, Robert J Trapnell, paid about $510,00 in Mansion Taxes. 

The buyers could not comment on their plans for the site.

The sellers have owned the property since it was built and the land before then.  The vacancies occurred over time.  The building needs updating, but the sellers did not have the energy.  It was an as-is sale, and the buyer gave a non-contingent offer.  It was not part of a 1031 exchange.  The brokers estimated a proforma cap rate of 5.4%.  The buyer was drawn to the location and the value-add opportunity that the vacant units allow for.

This transaction comes months after Astani Enterprises acquired the leased fee in September for $10.8 million from another party. The seller in this transaction had owned the leasehold since 1999, but sued the land owners (Stratton Family Revocable Trust) in 2017 claiming that the owners then had incorrectly appraised the property. Astani and the ground owner came to an agreement for the purchase of the land for $10.8MM. For information regarding that sale, see COMP ID 6169031.

At the time of sale, the property was 89% leased, with a 3.5% CAP Rate. 

Information about the sale was confirmed by the broker and property management.

Known as the Aliso Apartments, the property is a 472-unit apartment community.

The seller and buyer were represented.

The seller and buyer co-developed the property which was originally going to be a joint development between Legendary and Associated Estates Management prior to Associated Estates' acquisition by Brookfield in August 2015.

It is believed that the seller and buyer both retain a 50% interest in the property following the sale, although this has not been confirmed.

This was done simultaneously with the buyer taking out a $186.6 million loan from Equitable Financial Life Insurance Company. The terms of the loan were not known at the time of publication.

A source deemed reliable confirmed the sale price, the percent of interest sold, the number of units,",,83(2 + 2) ,89325,,,
